# AppleFrameworks 

AppleFrameworks is a SwiftUI app designed to showcase and provide insights into Apple's frameworks. The app presents a user-friendly interface with two main screens, a grid where you can explore Apple's ecosystem of frameworks, and a sheet that pops up if you click any framework.

## App Overview

### Grid View
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a grid view displaying Apple's frameworks. This screen is built using `NavigationStack` and `LazyVGrid`, offering a responsive layout that adjusts across different device sizes.

### Sheet View
Tapping on any framework card triggers a detailed view presented as a sheet. This view provides more comprehensive information about the selected framework, including a "Learn More" button that redirects users to the official Apple documentation for the selected framework.
